# Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing to the `serverd` project!

There are a couple of ways to start contributing right away, depending on your background and interests. The primary areas of contribution are development, testing, documentation, localization/internationalization, security, and feedback.

## Development
If you would like to contribute directly to the development process, you should start by setting up your development environment. If there is no link here to the project Wiki describing how to do this, something has gone terribly wrong, and you should create an issue so we can fix this right away.

## Testing
Testing as a primary activity, conducted with intentionality rather than as an incidental, auxiliary process, is extremely important. However, the first goal of this project is to create a feature-complete server, which will be retrofitted with a test suite.

If you are horrified by the ordering of this development process, you're just the kind of person we'd love to have on the team! If you feel you don't have the time, the background, or even the energy (emotional or otherwise) to contribute actual tests, we'd love it if you opened an issue with your feedback. This can include advice, comments, and criticisms; we look forward to your input!
